API Proxy Server using Node.js with Express.js

This Node.js application is a lightweight API proxy server built using Express.js. It acts as an intermediary between clients and external APIs, offering features like rate limiting, caching, logging, and basic token-based authentication.

Features
Rate Limiting: Limits the number of requests per IP to a maximum of 5 requests per minute. This prevents abuse and ensures fair usage.

Caching: Caches successful responses from the external API for 5 minutes, reducing unnecessary API calls and improving performance.

Error Handling: Gracefully handles errors from external APIs and provides meaningful responses to the client.

Logging: Logs each incoming request with essential details such as the timestamp, IP address, and rate limit status, helping in debugging and tracking.

Authentication: Implements token-based authentication to secure the proxy endpoint, ensuring that only authorized users can access it.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v14.x or higher)
npm (v6.x or higher)

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/API-Proxy-Server-using-Node.js.git
cd API-Proxy-Server-using-Node.js
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file to store your environment variables, such as:

makefile
Copy code
API_URL=<YOUR_EXTERNAL_API_ENDPOINT>
PORT=3000
API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY_FOR_EXTERNAL_API>
AUTH_TOKEN=<YOUR_SECRET_AUTH_TOKEN>
Usage
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Make requests to the proxy server:

Base URL: http://localhost:3000/api
Authentication: Add the Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN> header to all your requests.
Example cURL request:

bash
Copy code
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>" http://localhost:3000/api/resource


Rate Limiting
The server uses rate limiting to restrict requests to 5 per minute per IP. If this limit is exceeded, the server will return a 429 Too Many Requests error.

Caching
Responses from the external API are cached for 5 minutes to reduce redundant requests and improve performance. Cached responses are served for repeated requests within the caching period.

Authentication
The proxy server requires token-based authentication for access. To access any endpoint, you must include a valid token in the Authorization header as Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>.

Logging
The server logs each request with the following details:

Timestamp of the request
Client's IP address
Rate limit status (how many requests remain)
Requested resource
This helps with tracking and troubleshooting API usage.

Error Handling
In case of any errors from the external API, the server responds with an appropriate error message and status code, such as 500 Internal Server Error for server issues or 404 Not Found if the external API endpoint is unreachable.

Environment Variables
API_URL: The URL of the external API you're proxying.
PORT: The port on which the server will run (default is 3000).
API_KEY: Your external API's authentication key (optional, depending on the API).
AUTH_TOKEN: The token required to access the proxy endpoint.
